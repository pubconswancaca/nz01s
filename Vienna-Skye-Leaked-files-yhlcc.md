Vienna Skye's artistic style is characterized by her use of vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and thought-provoking themes. Her works often explore the human condition, examining topics such as identity, emotions, and the passage of time. Vienna Skye's influences include the works of Yayoi Kusama, Frida Kahlo, and Vincent van Gogh. Vienna Skye has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
